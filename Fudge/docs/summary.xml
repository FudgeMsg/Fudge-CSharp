      <summary>
        Fudge is a hierarchical, typesafe, binary, self-describing message encoding system.

            <term>Hierarchical</term>
            <description>Fudge messages aren't just a flat structure, they can be nested, creating larger, more complex data structures.</description>
          </item>
          <item>
            <term>Typesafe</term>
            <description>Individual fields in a Fudge message are provided with their type data encoded, so that you can extract data safely.</description>
          </item>
          <item>
            <term>Binary</term>
            <description>Fudge encoded data is binary, making it much smaller than text-based representations like XML or JSON.</description>
          </item>
          <item>
            <term>Self-Describing</term>
            <description>Fudge messages contain metadata about the fields encoded (like a name or an ordinal), meaning that you can manipulate them without knowing the schema in advance.</description>
          </item>
          <item>
            <term>Message</term>
            <description>Fudge was originally designed for encoding data to pass in a Message Oriented Middleware system, and so are more suited to the types of objects likely to be transmitted over a network connection than to a pure streaming mode.</description>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>Fudge, however, is not a Message Oriented Middleware platform or standard. While Fudge works well in MOM environments, it really focuses more on what goes in the body of the messages you send. Fudge works great with HTTP, JMS, and AMQP as the underlying network transport.</para>
